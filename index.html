            Skin care, clothing styles I would like to try, makeup looks I would like to be bold enough to do.
            Sometimes I just feel completely lost as to what I want to do because I just want to do so many things.
            Hence, the name. I don't even know what I will incorporate on this blog but I will incorporate something that should be useful to us all.
            Workouts, skin care, what I have been following, what I should follow, and what I want to follow. If you have gotten this far congratulations because
            at this point even I don't know what I am talking about anymore.</td>
            <td id="About">Hi! My name is Shriya Bangaru! I am a rising senior at Lebanon Trail High School in Frisco, Texas. I have lived in Texas for about 12 years but
              I was born in San Jose, California. I am very dedicated to Tae Kwon Do and somewhat dedicated to music. I play piano and french horn and I am
              part of the band and marching band at my school. As a chapter of my life comes to an end, I want to become more independent and learn what is best for me.
              Before I go to college, I want to have products I will use and routines I will follow to keep myself healthy and glowing. So, here is to my start to embrace
              my skin, hair, and body. I can't wait!

        <h6 id="SkinType">About my Skin<h6>
        <div id="DescSkin">
          So, to be honest I think it is wrong to determine that one has like a specific type of skin. It really just doesn't make sense to have a type of skin.
          That's why I want to try to use products and hacks that would be more so suitable for all skin types because I feel that every person does have a
          mixture of many skin types. Of course, I know and I have been told many times by professional and non-professionals that I have dry skin. In fact,
          as an infant, I suffered from eczema. Now, I still have very dry skin but I just don't always feel like my face is one of those areas. Somedays it's dry
          and some days it is oily. So, what do I do? I don't know. But I plan on utilizing this blog to organize my findings in hopes that it could help someone else
          suffering with the same dilemma as me.
