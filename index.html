            Skin care, clothing styles I would like to try, makeup looks I would like to be bold enough to do.
            Sometimes I just feel completely lost as to what I want to do because I just want to do so many things.
            Hence, the name. I don't even know what I will incorporate on this blog but I will incorporate something that should be useful to us all.
            Workouts, skin care, what I have been following, what I should follow, and what I want to follow. If you have gotten this far congratulations because
            at this point even I don't know what I am talking about anymore.</td>
            <td id="About">Hi! My name is Shriya Bangaru! I am a rising senior at Lebanon Trail High School in Frisco, Texas. I have lived in Texas for about 12 years but
              I was born in San Jose, California. I am very dedicated to Tae Kwon Do and somewhat dedicated to music. I play piano and french horn and I am
              part of the band and marching band at my school. As a chapter of my life comes to an end, I want to become more independent and learn what is best for me.
              Before I go to college, I want to have products I will use and routines I will follow to keep myself healthy and glowing. So, here is to my start to embrace
              my skin, hair, and body. I can't wait!

        <h6 id="SkinType">About my Skin</h6>
        <div id="DescSkin">
          So, to be honest I think it is wrong to determine that one has like a specific type of skin. It really just doesn't make sense to have a type of skin.
          That's why I want to try to use products and hacks that would be more so suitable for all skin types because I feel that every person does have a
          mixture of many skin types. Of course, I know and I have been told many times by professional and non-professionals that I have dry skin. In fact,
          as an infant, I suffered from eczema. Now, I still have very dry skin but I just don't always feel like my face is one of those areas. Somedays it's dry
          and some days it is oily. So, what do I do? I don't know. But I plan on utilizing this blog to organize my findings in hopes that it could help someone else
          suffering with the same dilemma as me.

        <h6 id="WorkRoutine">My Workout Routine</h6>
        <div id="Works">
          If I am being honest, I really didn't find an interest in working out until I turned 17. Until then I was completely happy with how I looked
          and my body. Also, for almost 7 years, I had Taekwondo that counted for me as working out just because I did it so often and it was physical activity.
          Once, I stopped and took a break I knew I was out of shape but that didn't bother me. Eventually, I started to notice areas where I used to have lean muscle
          that was getting replaced by fat. I didn't want that for me. After all those years of work, I didn't want to have fat weight instead of muscle mass. So, I made
          it a priority to try to stay fit and get back to lean muscle building and occassional cardio. So, I force my workout routine to comprise of all those components
          during the course of the week.
        </div>
        <h6 id="ClothNeed">Clothes that I "need"</h6>
        <div id="Clothing">
          I haven't actually replaced anything in my closet in a very long time. In fact, I haven't gotten anything new to add to my closet either. But, there
          have been a lot of styles and items of clothing that I have been wanting to try. I know they may not all suit me but I atleast want a chance to try
          them and decide for myself something new to make a statement with. Also I lack much casual clothing so if you're into that...stay tuned. I quite literally
          have one sweatshirt and a bunch of different croppedish pullovers and I kind of realized that isn't going to cut it for college so I definetely need to up
          my casual game a bit and maybe my fancy pants game later.

        <h6 id="GoodFood">Experiment Bake</h6>
        <div id="Bake">
          I LOVE baking! I know that isn't anything special but for real I enjoy it so much. It feels so nice to create something that the whole family can
          enjoy and when it comes out just right it is always so satisfying. However, I am always afraid to try something new. Not necessarily a new recipe but a
          recipe that requires a new technique or skill that I haven't used before. That's why I am going to start slow, and try to incorporate different techniques into
          new recipes so that I can truly be satisfied with myself and my abilities. So, here I will have many bold desserts with various bold flavors and I PROMISE
          that they won't be a bunch of cakes ;).
