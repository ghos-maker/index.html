        <div id="Intro">
          To be honest, even I don't know what this is. I think it is kind of just a place where I am going to put everything that I would like to know.
          Skin care, clothing styles I would like to try, makeup looks I would like to be bold enough to do.
          Sometimes I just feel completely lost as to what I want to do because I just want to do so many things.
          Hence, the name. I don't even know what I will incorporate on this blog but I will incorporate something that should be useful to us all.
          Workouts, skin care, what I have been following, what I should follow, and what I want to follow. If you have gotten this far congratulations because
          at this point even I don't know what I am talking about anymore.

        <div id="About">
          Hi! My name is Shriya Bangaru! I am a rising senior at Lebanon Trail High School in Frisco, Texas. I have lived in Texas for about 12 years but
          I was born in San Jose, California. I am very dedicated to Tae Kwon Do and somewhat dedicated to music. I play piano and french horn and I am
          part of the band and marching band at my school. As a chapter of my life comes to an end, I want to become more independent and learn what is best for me.
          Before I go to college, I want to have products I will use and routines I will follow to keep myself healthy and glowing. So, here is to my start to embrace
          my skin, hair, and body. I can't wait!
